My name is Yeerkenbieke Yeerna, you can call me Eric and my user name is Yernarah63
My goal for this course is To gain a solid understanding of Python programming fundamentals, including basic syntax, data structures, and problem-solving techniques, in order to build a strong foundation for further study or practical application in coding projects.
My first python program prints "Hello, World!" to the console. print("Hello, World!")
# Define a function to print "Hello, World!"
def print_hello_world():
    # Code block within the function
    print("Hello, World!")

# Call the function to execute the code block
print_hello_world()
